IMM230 Primer

Hello!

Bobby here, I'm using GitHub as a student to aid in my work for a class called IMM230, Dynamic Web Applications. I have previous experience in JavaScript, Processing, P5.js, and Java. I'm hoping to learn more about the language Ruby and the dynamic process of maintaining and updating code in online repositories.
